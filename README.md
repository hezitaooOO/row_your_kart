## Getting Started With The Project

This project requires [Unity](https://unity.com/download) to build and run. I highly recommend using [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/unity-hub) to manage the project. Clone this repository and open the root folder in Unity Hub.

## Steps to open the project in Unity:
1. Clone the repo.
2. Make sure you have Unity Hub (https://unity.com/unity-hub) and Unity downloaded (https://unity.com/download).
3. Open Unity Hub and click "Open".

Then select the folder "row_your_kart". The project should open in Unity.
